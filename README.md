# Recipes

## Description

This is a spare-time project that I am currently working on. Its goal is to address a problem in my private life: deciding what to have for dinner. Here is an overview of the recipes we enjoy making and eating.

## Project Overview

The primary goal is to build a website using the new Nextjs App Router to improve my skills in modern frontend technologies and at the same time make a usable product. 

The objective is to create a page that only includes recipes I like and provides them in a structured view. I will manually enter all the recipes in a DatoCMS setup to gain more experience with GraphQL and codegen. This will also make it convenient to add, remove, and edit recipes as needed.

The recipes should be displayed in a simple overview with a fuzzy search mechanism, making it easy to find dinner meal inspiration on days when creativity is low. In the future, I plan to add a 'weekly dinner plan' generator that randomly selects recipes from the list. This generator will have filter options to customize the plan according to preferences.








## Technologies used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

`Next.js` To create an MPA

`GraphQL` To use flexible APIs

`Codegen` To generate types from GraphQL schemas

`Tailwindcss` To facilitate a utility-first and component-based approach to building UI

`TypeScript` To enhance code maintainability and reliability
